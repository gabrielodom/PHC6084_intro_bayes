# Autocorrelation

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
acf(res2_ls$chain[, "mu"], main = "Mu")
pacf(res2_ls$chain[, "mu"], main = "Mu")
acf(res2_ls$chain[, "sigma"], main = "Sigma")
pacf(res2_ls$chain[, "sigma"], main = "Sigma")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
# Our jumping SD for sigma is probably too small (we are currently using 1 for
#   mu and 0.25 for sigma). We could also increase the thinning.
```


# Burn-in and Thinning

```{r}
# thin_int <- 1L # see PACF below
thin_int <- 20L 
burnIn_int <- 1000L

keepSamps_idx <- seq(
	from = burnIn_int + 1,
	to = nrow(res_ls$chain),
	by = thin_int
)
```

Now we update the results.
```{r}
res2_ls <- res_ls
res2_ls$chain <- res2_ls$chain[keepSamps_idx, ]
res2_ls$acceptance <- res2_ls$acceptance[keepSamps_idx, ]
```

# Chain Mixing

## Acceptance Rates
```{r}
# There are NAs, but I don't know why
mean(res2_ls$acceptance[, "mu"], na.rm = TRUE)
mean(res2_ls$acceptance[, "sigma"], na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Chain Plots
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(res2_ls$chain[, "mu"], type = "l", lty = 1, main = "Chain for mu")
plot(res2_ls$chain[, "sigma"], type = "l", lty = 1, main = "Chain for sigma")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
# I'm worried about autocorrelation in the sigma values
```

# Poster Distribution Samples

## Quantiles of the Posterior

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(res2_ls$chain[, "mu"], main = "Posterior for mu")
hist(res2_ls$chain[, "sigma"], main = "Posterior for sigma")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

The credible intervals are:
```{r}
# Mu
quantile(res2_ls$chain[, "mu"], c(0.005, 0.025, 0.05, 0.95, 0.975, 0.995))
quantile(res2_ls$chain[, "sigma"], c(0.005, 0.025, 0.05, 0.95, 0.975, 0.995))
```
